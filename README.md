# Overview of Election-Audit

This project uses voting data from three distinct counties in Colorado to calculate the results of this election and provides statistical analysis to support these results. I received the vote counts in a large CSV file. The first step was to analyze the data to determine the winner. The second layer of analysis involved determining the voter turnout. Finally, this analysis and the statistics to support it was re-written onto a text file.
