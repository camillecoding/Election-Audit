# Election-Audit


## Overview of Election-Audit ##

This project uses voting data from three distinct counties in Colorado to calculate the results of this election and provides statistical analysis to support these results. I received the vote counts in a large CSV file. The first step was to analyze the data to determine the winner. The second layer of analysis involved determining the voter turnout. Finally, this analysis and the statistics to support it was re-written onto a text file. 

## Election-Audit Results ##

Election audits help to support public faith in the integrity of a country's electoral process and in democracy more widely. While projections for election results provide some short-term relief, the information uncovered in audits like these are an essential part of verifying the results.

## Election-Audit Summary ##

In summary, this audit illuminates not only each candidate's performance in the election, but also how each of the counties performed in terms of their voter turnout. The code embedded into this project could be modified to reflect different regions and candidates, producing an accurate analysis of future elections. As long as the election data is complete, the section of the code that would require editing for each audit would be the candidate's names and the counties where votes have been cast. 

This code could be useful both in highly contested elections and more frequent state or local elections. This code would have been useful in the recent November 2021 election in Denver, and could also be useful in the upcoming 2022 state-wide elections.
